# HOW TO USE DISCORD WEBHOOK
When installing the logger you will need to link a webhook url to the logger for it to work. In order to do this, you must create a channel in a Discord specifically for the logger.__
Once created: right click on the channel -> Edit Channel -> Integrations -> Create Webhook -> Click on the Webhook created -> Copy Webhook URL__
After doing that, you start the logger and for the first time it will ask you to insert the URL. To paste a link in the terminal just press RIGHT CLICK on the mouse and it will paste anything
in the transfer area.__
MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT INSERT THE WRONG LINK, OTHERWISE YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY CHANGE IT IN THE .PY FILE.
